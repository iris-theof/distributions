## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

A package that provides ready functions to deal with Gaussian, Binomial and Bernoulli distributions. Including calculation of mean, standard deviation, parameteers, Probability Density Function, plotting options for a given set of data.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Inside the distributions folder there are 3 '.py' files that correspond to each one of the distributions considered. The 'Genearldistribution.py' in the same folder contains a method to initialize and to read data files that correspond to any distribution. The test.py provides unittests and the numbers_binomial.txt and numbers_gaussian.txt are example of data files with data that correspond to these distributions.

Feel free to use the code in this repository as you would like! 
The original code for the Gaussian and Binomial code distributions was taken from the PyPi package distributions.
